                    <p>Frieren has an easy-going personality, however, her aloof attitude makes her a mystery to her peers, as humans and elves tend to see things differently.</p>
                    <p>Although she is generally stoic, carefree, and often lacks tact, Frieren also has things she is emotionally sensitive to.</p>
